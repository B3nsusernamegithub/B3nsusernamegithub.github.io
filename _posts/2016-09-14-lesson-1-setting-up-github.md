    <td>The way I learnt to set up github is by listening to the teacher and taking down notes so that I could use the notes when I had to set up github. This was effective because it meant that I could go away and do the thing Mr Keen set use with out forgeting anything. another thing that was effective was to look at the slides on classsroom.</td>
