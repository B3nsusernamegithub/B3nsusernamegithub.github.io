    <td>This lesson i had a rugby match and only had the first ten minutes of the lesson this meant i didn't know how to create a table so then i talked to the people who do it and they told me where to go on w3schools. i also asked my dad to help me and he ca
  gave me hints. This is because he uses sheets for his work. </td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning is not being there in the lesson to know what the tables should look like also the other thing is that i couldn't edit the tables. </td>
